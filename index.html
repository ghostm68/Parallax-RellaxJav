        ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT THE UNKNOWN IS ASTIR  
        (a reckoning or two by inky)
        > I was reading the Graves talk from a Paris Review  interview and it
>> seems he didn’t much care for Milton. I don’t blame him, I took a
>> peekaboo at Paradise Lost and Found and couldn’t get into it.
>>
>> In any case, Graves says it’s obvious to him that Milton was a hair
>> freak and unfortunately so constipated  that an awful smell came
>> through his writing.
>>
>> Clearly, not a compliment.
>>
>> It brought to mind the rather shocking passage from Hemingway’s A
>> Moveable Feast. I mean the one in which he brought to light an
>> arguably private incident between himself and F. Scott Fitzgerald.
>>
>> I haven’t yet had such a strong visceral sensation while reading an
>> author. Dead or alive.
>>
>> And I hope not to have need or occasion to hop into some unveiling of
>> any hush-hush position which I might have been alongside or which I
>> shall be sharing in the wrong or right of future songs or lights.
>>
>> The prelude is a passing thought.
>>
>> I didn’t feel near to those scriveners, although I have cultivated a
>> great appreciation or respect for Fitzgerald, and I can pretty much
>> postulate that I still don’t.
>>
>> What really caught my reality was how real and unexpectedly close mine
>> own  mythos comes to Graves’ ideology.
>>
>> For example, his briefly related  theory that time doesn’t really
>> exist.  It is an idea that has sweetly distracted my thoughts since I
>> developed more substantial interests than say what is common to a
>> schoolboy.
>>
>> Of course, I didn’t have occasion to entertain Mr Graves’ philosophy
>> before browsing that Q&A.
>>
>> Read I, Claudius and the second historical novel. I’d seen the
>> photoplay production and years later read some of his verse.
>>
>> And The White Goddess happens to be high on my reading list.
>>
>> I thought to think back through writers that have made me feel
>> something, something beyond concept or sentiment. Those are common,
>> even among the so-called hacks and hounds that pretend to be scribes.
>>
>>
>> Tolkien and Steinbeck were early inspirations. Wonder and empathy,
>> respectively came through their work. Dickinson and Cummings came a
>> little later. Admiration and perhaps envy, filtered into my senses.
>>
>> However, it is difficult to detail the exact emotions because it was
>> during a time when I was also learning about the so-called birds and
>> the bees.
>>
>> Biographies perked my interest but it wasn’t until I picked up Beat
>> Generation writers that I realized how wide open, how wonderful, how
>> wise  the world of literature could be.
>>
>> Equally, philosophy -with its sometimes poisoned delusion that tries
>> to position an exact definition of an abstraction until it is drowned
>> past logic with so many words and references– raised my curiosity but
>> I trust that I am not alone in stating that the eloquent simplicity of
>> the Eastern School of thought pretty much says it all.  Nietzsche
>> might be poetic, but Lao Tse is a poem. One’s pretentious. The other’s
>> without pomp.
>>
>> I write it without hesitation, although it seems that any sensible
>> argument for the construct of karma or for that matter spiritual
>> consequence is entirely devoid of reason.  I should add that I hope I
>> am wrong for I have my faith and after all this who wouldn’t want some
>> type of heaven…
>> The obvious response, if we may take a minute for frivolity, is the
>> nonbeliever…‘I am an atheist, thank G-d’, someone quipped.
>>
>> In any case, there are several or perhaps more than several books and
>> certainly poems which I could point to as containing a type of
>> greatness which seduces as if the perfect lover were holding your hand
>> and whispering in your ear that love is true.
>>
>> For example, Master and Margarita, The Drunken Boat, The Pisan Cantos,
>>  Night, and to make a long list particularly abbreviated, the
>> overwhelming and impossible creation that is Finnegan’s Wake.
>>
>>Recently, to return to the subject as it were, when I read the first
>> section of Anne Rice’s recent historical novel about Jesus, I felt the
>> presence of a child.  When I read Norman Mailer’s first chapter of
>> Castle In The Forest, I felt an uneasy curiosity which could possibly
>> be defined within some spiritual realm.
>>
>>  I don’t think one is either capable or open enough to get any feeling
>> from too many writers. Of course, it is an arguable point that there
>> are -at any given time– very few writers capable of offering a real
>> sensation, a daring sentiment which makes the reader feel what should
>> be termed ethereal.
>>
>> All this without taking into account articles, essays, The Bible, and
>> Shakespeare, and  especially screenplays…
>>
>> In the interview, he contradicts himself a bit.  It is a tender irony
>> that one would have to sleep on or contemplate further after reading,
>> at least if one is -alike myself– entirely engaged in the text instead
>> of evaluating the exact signification.
>>
>> If memory serves, he implies that poets “move” from one muse to
>> another as a matter of consequence or simple harvesting of aliveness…
>> The changes which lead to experience…
>>
>> That is, on one side. On the other, he suggests, that it is wayward
>> for a maker of verse to be wanton.
>>
>> The implication and the suggestion seem -at least to yours truly– to
>> resist each other on several levels.
>>
>> One could see it as the eternal conflict between flesh and
>> spirituality, given the premise that there is a  dispute amid sex and
>> faith.
>>
>>
>>
>> Is there?
>>
>> My own lingering thought and limited experience tells me there is. Of
>> course, in any possible reality or any realness that is within reach,
>> there doesn’t have to be any feud.
>>
>> It is simply a matter of view point. We have allowed sexuality to be
>> categorized, catalogued, and controlled by church and state.  A rather
>> unfortunate situation for humanity, a group that by and large is at
>> its best when breeding (if this is not a clear point, simply consider
>> the obvious; no offspring equals no future.)
>>
>> I propose a, if we may take another minute for folly, a sex Olympics.
>> My apologies to the homosexuals and anchorites, for indeed the purpose
>> would be pregnancy and birth.
>>
>>
>>
>> It could be, within our advancing medical knowledge, done as
>> non-contact sport, but someone would need to restrain the
>> Mediterranean and Tropical participants.
>>
>> Might as well do it the old-fashioned way.
>>
>> I digress.
>>
>>  And to conclude, as if this were anywhere near an essay, I am most
>> certainly a hair freak. Luckily I never did eat enough to be truly
>> constipated.
>>
>> If my writing smells, I hope it is the odor of Clove cigarettes,
>> coffee,  the city I happen to inhabit, or that it has been published
>> by a scratch and sniff magazine.
>>
>> No matter, the resolve resides in the reader’s interpretation, what
>> Nabokov claimed to be most important: the individual reader.
>>
>>
>>
>> Sometimes, the reader is my self.
>>
>> Sometimes, it is another.
>>
>> All the work under the wild wisdom which is understandably muse, which
>> is undeniably woman.
>>
>> How lucky am I to have found a kindred spirit in Robert Graves? Excuse
>> my quasi–rebuke in the passing thought prelude, it’s just that even
>> kindred spirits might find reasons for dancing on the ground of
>> disagreement.
>>
>> Of course, I am not so determinedly stubborn – despite my sometimes
>> narrow reckoning – to admit that there could have been some other
>> meaning in his seemingly whimsical evaluation of Milton.
>>
>>
>>
>>
>>
>> Be that as it may, I am away to pen for the muse, to pine for the
>> higher music of love and learning, to waylay the weighty sorrows with
>> page-turning prose and tingling poetry.

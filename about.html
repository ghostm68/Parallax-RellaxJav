        i was walking down up in the rotterdam
Still waking up from some dream I don’t recall
A sign on the street-lamp said
Too blessed to be stressed

My semi-new writing system told me to pen a poem
I wasn’t in any eagerness, I had swallowed my eggs
Got some smokes and watched that smoking show
See I have written more than a fair number

Already it’s the next saint patrick’s day
I hope in somewhere minutes I will be again in bliss
As I was this gone monday with the goils
And my washed tongue untied

The next line doesn’t enter mind and yet
A longing to roam away over the far hills
Remains with that desire for her hand
Sharp as uncharged shrapnel

I am scratched alike the old vinyl recording
I am sincere just like those ancient lyrics
I am sinning only to be saved down the line
I am singing alone in the old-fashioned wee hours

As luck would have it love only echoes a feeling
Fast as lightning the dawn will arrive with flowers
As my fingers reach for her strategically torn stockings
And the hollow silence of infidelity burns my conscience

I was only in a fantasy yet her eyes bit
The truth within my heart

Devil demon there would be neither divinity nor sacred dance
Without evil’s naked wound

Demon devil they could not exist without the good lord’s consent
within this thread we prick and press

I was walking down up in the rotterdam
Still waking up from some dream I don’t recall
A sign on the street-lamp said
Too blessed to be stressed
